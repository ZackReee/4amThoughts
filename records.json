Even the perspective of neutrality is but a pendulum, a metronome in strive of balance. Accept people for who they are till they've chosen to prove you otherwise. Move on and find someone who is more"},
  {"title":"Realisation of being lost", "date":"08 May 2021", "entry":"Finally, I have slightly more clarity towards myself now. Seemingly, being bad with directions and having a mid life crisis shares a similar prime, as this weird, unusual mind of mine has been able to that connection. As big of a day dreamer, attention hasn't been paid in full towards the norm. This people, environment, activities & interactions unless they are of a stimulating nature."},
  {"title":"The chase for a high", "date":"09 May 2021", "entry":"Having met the ideal person of my dreams, someone who I feel a connection towards, I am now constantly being drawn by my need for the sensation of connection, interaction, discovery, discussion, intimacy, and joy. Isolation feels lonely & melancholic, if not for the constant reminder that life is pretty much insignificant in hindsight. Eventually everything ends, so do what you want, be what you want, and so you don't regret for every shot you don't take is another that you miss. Still, living life like this is difficult."}
