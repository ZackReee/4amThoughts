Even the perspective of neutrality is but a pendulum, a metronome in motion towards that of balance. Accept people for who they are till they've chosen to prove you otherwise. Avoid those going against your alignment whatever it is. Move on and find someone more aligned with you and one day you will find someone you fit right in with."},
  {"title":"Realisation of being lost", "date":"08 May 2021", "entry":"Finally, I have slightly more clarity towards myself now. Seemingly, being bad with directions and having a mid-life crisis shares a similar prime in unfolding the mysteries that I hold as this weird, unusual mind of mine has been able to seemingly make that strange connection. As big of a daydreamer, attention hasn't been paid in full towards the norm. Little towards people, environment, activities & interactions unless they are somewhat stimulating. So if I've got my eyes on you, you're one special snow flake and I love you lots."},
  {"title":"The chase for a high", "date":"09 May 2021", "entry":"Being able to meet the person of my dreams, someone who I feel an immense connection towards, now that sure would feel amazing. Probably equally devastating and depressing too. For now, I am now constantly being drawn by my needs for the sensations of connection, excitement, interaction, discovery, discussion, intimacy, reaction, and joy. Isolation feels lonely & melancholic, if not for the constant reminder that life is pretty much insignificant in hindsight. Eventually, everything ends, so do what you want, be what you want, so you don't regret it. Every shot you don't take is another that you miss. Still, living a life like this is going to prove difficult. The worse comes when the time comes where the Schrodinger's box is unveiled, leading to the revelation that this is indeed a one-way road that has no way back..."},
  {"title":"Why are you NOT running?", "date":"13 May 2021", "entry":"Being under-appreciated sure feels bad. But you should never solely rely on someone else for your happiness or acknowledgement. If the person is showing signs of not wanting to be involved, that's a pretty big telltale. So please do yourself a favour and just move on. Stop giving yourself false hope, because you are running away from the truth and instead, not the person that doesn't give 2 fucks about you. It can be very tough, especially when the person seems to be everything that you have asked for, but sometimes what you are isn't something that they are asking for... just an unlucky life. "}
