Seemingly, being bad with directions and having mid life crisis shares a similar prime  . That which is the failure to find oneself. And if I shall be unable to find myself, it is no wonder I am currently incapable to be found by others - including a potential partner. I shall divert my efforts into finding myself... Hopefully one day someone will be able to find me, and I'll be able to live life the way I want to live."}
